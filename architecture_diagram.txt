# Document Organization Software Architecture

## Client Side (React Frontend)
- **Pages**
  - Authentication Pages (Login, Register, Password Reset)
  - Dashboard Pages (Document Management, Profile Update)
  - Admin Dashboard (User Management, KYC Management, Admin Document Management)
  - Document Features (Upload, Summaries, Chat)

- **State Management (Redux)**
  - Auth Store (User Authentication, Profile Management)
  - Document Store (Document CRUD Operations)
  - Summary Store (Document Summarization)
  - Chat Store (AI Chat Functionality)
  - Folder Store (Folder Management)

- **Services**
  - API Services (HTTP Requests to Backend)
  - Authentication Services
  - Document Services
  - Summary Services
  - Chat Services

## Server Side (Node.js Backend)
- **API Routes**
  - Authentication Routes (/api/auth/*)
  - Document Routes (/api/doc/*)
  - Folder Routes (/api/folder/*)
  - Summaries Routes (/api/summeries/*)
  - Chat Routes (/api/chat/*)

- **Controllers**
  - AuthController (User Authentication, Registration, Profile Management)
  - DocumentController (Document Upload, Management, Categorization)
  - FolderController (Folder Creation, Document Organization)
  - SummeriesController (Document Summarization)
  - ChatController (AI Chat Functionality)

- **Middleware**
  - Authentication Middleware (JWT Validation)
  - File Upload Middleware
  - Error Handling Middleware
  - CORS Configuration

- **Models**
  - User Model
  - Document Model
  - Folder Model
  - Summary Model
  - Chat Model

- **Database**
  - MongoDB (Document Storage)

- **External Services**
  - OAuth Providers (Google, Facebook)
  - AI Services for Chat and Summarization

## Data Flow
1. User authenticates via frontend authentication pages
2. JWT token is generated and stored for subsequent requests
3. User interacts with document management features
4. API requests are sent to appropriate backend routes
5. Controllers process requests and interact with models
6. Database operations are performed
7. Responses are sent back to frontend
8. Frontend updates state and UI accordingly

## Security Features
- JWT Authentication
- OAuth Integration
- Secure File Upload
- API Endpoint Protection
- CORS Security Configuration
